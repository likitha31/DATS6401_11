Data visualization project for DATS6401 course
# Traffic Stop Dataset Visualization

## Overview

This traffic stop dataset serves as a valuable resource for visualization purposes, offering insights into trends and patterns in law enforcement actions. It can shed light on various aspects such as racial disparities in traffic stops, distribution of stops by time and location, and the prevalence of different offenses. Visualizing this data can enhance transparency and aid in making informed policy decisions.

## Dataset Description

The dataset is well-suited for this project as it is multivariate, containing both numerical (e.g., latitude, longitude, subject age, precinct) and categorical data (e.g., location, violation type, race, sex). It surpasses the requirement of 50,000 observations, comprising over 100,000 records. It is publicly available for download from the Stanford website.

## Static Plots

1. **Subject Race Distribution**: Pie chart illustrating the distribution of traffic stops among different racial groups.
2. **Violation Frequency**: Bar graph showcasing the frequency of different types of violations.
3. **Subject Age Distribution**: Histogram presenting the age distribution of individuals stopped.
4. **Outcome Comparison**: Stacked bar chart comparing outcomes (warning, citation, arrest) across different violations.
5. **Location Concentration**: Visualization depicting the concentration of traffic stops in various areas of Nashville.

## Interactive Dashboard

1. **Demographic Breakdown**: Interactive pie charts and bar graphs updating based on user-selected filters, reflecting the distribution of stops by subject race, sex, and age.
2. **Comparison Box Plot**: Box plot of subject age distribution by subject race, allowing users to compare different race categories interactively.
3. **Map Visualization**: Map displaying the locations of traffic stops, with filtering options for demographics, outcomes, and violation types.
4. **Correlation Plot**: Drill-down feature enabling users to explore correlations between traffic stops and other factors such as subject race, location, or time.
5. **Time Series Analysis**: Interactive line graphs illustrating trends over time, with filtering capabilities for date, time of day, and violation type.

## Conclusion

Utilizing this traffic stop dataset for visualization purposes can provide valuable insights into law enforcement practices and help address issues of equity and accountability. By leveraging static plots and an interactive dashboard, stakeholders can better understand the data and make informed decisions for policy-making and community engagement.
